# minimal_rust_kernel
This is a minimal kernel written in Rust. It is purely for learning purposes.\
This project was meant as a systems development learning exercise.\
The core learning resource was [this blog post about building an Operating System in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/).

To make the development steps elaborate, each git branch in this repo corresponds to the blog-post numbering order.
